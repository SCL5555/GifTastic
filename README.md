# GifTastic


#  Purpose
This project demonstrates how to retrieve gifs from Giphy API, display them and also switch between the still image and gif on click.

#  Getting Started
To get started you press one of the animal buttons on the top of the page, or create your own using the form on the side of the page.  Each button name is the keyword that will be sent to Giphy, and ten gifs will be returned along with their rating.
